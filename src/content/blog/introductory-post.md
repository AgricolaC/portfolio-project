Yo, this is my personal corner of the internet — a site I designed to serve as both a portfolio and a blog, but more importantly, as a long-term space where I can share ideas without the baggage of platforms and algorithms.

So, why did I build it?

### 1. To Go Beyond the LinkedIn & CV Format
While LinkedIn and my PDF CV are fine for listing skills and job titles, they don't tell much about who I am, what drives me, or what problems I enjoy thinking about. This site gives me the space to showcase projects, explain my thinking, and let my personality come through.

### 2. To Gain Real Web Development Experience
I come from a background that blends computer engineering, data science, and machine learning. But one domain I hadn't touched was web design. So I built this from scratch using Astro, Tailwind CSS, and with the assistance of GPT (I'm a bad boy, what can I say). This project became an excuse to fill in a missing piece of my IT toolkit.

### 3. To Create a Personal Outlet Without Polluting Social Media
Let’s face it, social media is a mess. I wanted a place to post thoughts, opinions, explorations, or even light schizoposts without worrying about engagement, algorithms, or whether it’s appropriate for a certain platform. If it’s interesting to someone else — great. If not — it’s mine either way.

This site will grow with time. I’ll be writing about data science projects, notebook experiments, tools I like, and broader reflections on work, study, video games or whatever philosophical rabbit hole I fall into.

Thanks for reading, this is Berk and I want you to know that I will achieve great things one day, so you should note the name down.
