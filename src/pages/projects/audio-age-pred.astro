      This project tackles the challenge of predicting a speaker's age using acoustic and linguistic features extracted from audio recordings of speech. Using a dataset of over 3,600 speech samples collected under controlled conditions, we built a robust regression pipeline to estimate speaker age based on a wide range of features such as pitch, jitter, shimmer, zero-crossing rate, and harmonic-to-noise ratio. The task was evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and we ensured that the model generalized well by training on a development set and evaluating on a held-out evaluation set.    </p>
