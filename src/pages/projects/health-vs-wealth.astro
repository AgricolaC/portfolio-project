      <h2>üåç Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Why do some countries achieve high life expectancy with modest budgets, while others spend massively with little to show? This project explores this question using <strong>health spending data</strong> and <strong>life expectancy</strong> metrics across 1995‚Äì2014.
      </p>

      <h2>üì¶ Data Sources & Structure</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>World Bank: Health Expenditure (per capita, PPP-adjusted, % of GDP)</li>
        <li>World Bank: Life Expectancy at Birth (years)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We reshaped yearly data into long format and merged by ISO3 country codes.</p>

      <h2>üìà Long-Term Trends</h2>
      <p>Both health spending and life expectancy have risen globally, but inequality in investment far exceeds inequality in outcomes.</p>
      <img src="/images/life_expectancy_over_time.png" alt="Life Expectancy Over Time" class="rounded shadow-md my-6" />
      <p>Ethiopia (ETH) shows the steepest improvement, climbing from ~47 to ~65 years‚Äîa gain of nearly 18 years in two decades. Nigeria (NGA), despite spending more per capita on health, lags behind, rising from ~46 to only ~54 years. More spending does not guarantee better outcomes. Ethiopia‚Äôs success likely stems from effective public health programs, foreign aid utilization, and rapid improvements in maternal/child care.</p>
      <p>India (IND) and China (CHN) show steady, moderate gains. China's leap‚Äîfrom ~70 to ~76 years‚Äîtracks with rising healthcare investment and economic growth. Turkey (TUR) and Brazil (BRA) climb from low- to mid-70s, closely mirroring each other. Both show consistent upward trajectories and effective health reform during the 2000s.</p>
      <p>Japan (JPN) leads the chart, consistently above 83 years, reinforcing its global reputation for longevity. Norway (NOR) and Germany (DEU) follow closely, with life expectancies around 81‚Äì82 years. The United States (USA) remains below its peers‚Äîhovering around 78‚Äì79 years‚Äîdespite the highest per-capita health spending globally.
         This underperformance may highlight systemic inefficiencies, such as unequal access to care, chronic disease burden, and lack of universal insurance. It may also show that lifestyle differences take part.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/gini_over_time.png" alt="Gini Coefficients Over Time" class="rounded shadow-md my-6" />
      
      <h2>üåÄ Inequality Snapshot (2014)</h2>
      <p>We used the <strong>Gini Index</strong> and <strong>Lorenz Curves</strong> to visualize and quantify inequality across countries.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Life Expectancy Gini (2014): <strong>0.066</strong></li>
        <li>Health Spending (PPP per capita): <strong>0.61</strong></li>
        <li>Health Spending (% of GDP): <strong>0.17</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        While <strong>life expectancy Gini</strong> remains low (more equal), <strong>spending Gini</strong> reaches up to 0.70, revealing extreme disparities in investment.
      </p>
      <p>Global convergence in life expectancy is a success story: even with wildly different spending, the outcome gap is modest.</p>
      <p>Inequality in spending is deeply structural and barely improves over time, especially in raw dollar terms.</p>
      <p>PPP adjustments and GDP percentage offer more nuanced fairness metrics, but do not eliminate the underlying disparities.</p>

      <img src="/images/lorenz_curves_2014.png" alt="Lorenz Curves - 2014" class="rounded shadow-md my-6" />

      <p>These curves visually affirm the Gini analysis:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Life expectancy is a relatively fair outcome in global terms.
        </li>
        <li>Health spending (especially unadjusted) is highly unequal, with a few wealthy nations dominating the curve.
        </li>
        <li>This contrast invites a deeper look into healthcare efficiency, system design, and non-monetary factors impacting life expectancy (education, governance, nutrition, etc.).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>
        A small percentage of wealthy nations dominate global health spending ‚Äî but not necessarily global health outcomes.
      </blockquote>

      <h2>‚öñÔ∏è The Efficiency Frontier</h2>
      <p>
        We define a country‚Äôs health <strong>efficiency</strong> as the life expectancy it achieves for its spending. Using <strong>log-linear regression</strong> of PPP-adjusted health spending vs. life expectancy, we calculate residuals:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Positive residual ‚Üí Efficient (Green)</li>
        <li>Negative residual ‚Üí Inefficient (Red)</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="/images/efficiency_frontier_2014_health_exp_ppp_per_capita.png" alt="Efficiency Frontier - 2014" class="rounded shadow-md my-6" />

      <h3>üü¢ Most Efficient Countries</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sri Lanka:</strong> (Life Exp ~75.8 years; ~369 Dollars PPP per capita): Sri Lanka stands out for acheving near OECD levels of life expectancy with a modest budget. The secret is a long standing pro-poverty public health system. Since the 1930s Sri Lanka has provided free universal healthcare with a strong focus on preventive and primary care. This led to excellent maternal and child health indicators and control of infectious diseases ‚Äì ‚Äúmuch better outcomes‚Ä¶than would have been predicted by its income level,‚Äù as the World Bank notes. Crucially, Sri Lanka proved that even low levels of health spending can yield outstanding results: its experience shows that large budgets are not always required to achieve low infant mortality and long life. Continued investment in educated health workers, rural clinics, and preventive services paid off in one of the world‚Äôs most efficient health systems. </li>
        <li><strong>Eritrea:</strong> (Life Exp ~65.5 years; ~ 51 Dollars PPP per capita): Impoverished and isolated, Eritrea nonetheless emerges as an efficiency success story. ritrea‚Äôs government, often in collaboration with communities, prioritized cost-effective interventions: near-universal childhood vaccination, widespread malaria control, and health education contributed to a rapid fall in child and infant mortality. Indeed, Eritrea was one of the few African countries to achieve the health-related Millennium Development Goals, cutting under-5 mortality by two-thirds and boosting immunization to ~95% by 2015. The country‚Äôs approach ‚Äì tight government coordination, multi-sector community involvement, and innovative use of limited resources ‚Äì meant that even with very low expenditures, basic health outcomes improved dramatically. This makes Eritrea an outlier that attained high efficiency in health spending.  </li>
        <li><strong>Solomon Islands:</strong> (Life Exp ~69.0 years; ~ 108 Dollars PPP per capita): By 2014, the Solomon Islands had nearly 69 years life expectancy with only modest spending, again reflecting success against communicable diseases. In the 2000s, with post-conflict stability and external aid, the Solomons saw a marked decline in malaria and tuberculosis, historically major killers. Immunization coverage improved (though with some volatility due to geographic challenges). With most of its population rural and engaged in subsistence living, the country benefited from healthier diets and active lifestyles limiting chronic disease. Donor-supported programs for malaria bed nets, TB treatment, and primary care outreach in villages helped extend lifespan. Thus, the Solomons converted relatively low spending into a high life expectancy, underscoring the efficiency gains from targeted disease-control programs and community health efforts in the Pacific.  </li>
        <li><strong>Albania:</strong> (Life Exp ~78.0 years; ~ 615 Dollars PPP per capita): Albania offers an example from East Europe of efficient health spending. Despite spending only one-tenth of the highest spenders in Western Europe, Albania in 2014 achieved a life expectancy of about 78 years. This post-communist Balkan nation benefited from historical investments in basic healthcare and education ‚Äì for instance, widespread vaccination and health clinics were established in the communist era, giving a strong baseline. By the 2010s, Albania‚Äôs health profile (especially for maternal/child health) was similar to its higher-income neighbors. Lifestyle and diet may have played a role as well (a Mediterranean diet and tight-knit family support). Moreover, Albania has had no major epidemics and no wars since 1999, so its health gains weren‚Äôt derailed. The result is that Albania‚Äôs life expectancy surpassed many countries that spend far more, indicating a high-efficiency outcome. Its experience aligns with other middle-income Eastern European states that see rapidly improving longevity even with moderate health budgets.)</li>
        <li><strong>Bangladesh:</strong> (Life Exp ~70.0 years; ~ 88 Dollars PPP per capita): Bangladesh is often hailed as a <strong>health paradox</strong>, achieving remarkable health with very low per-capita spending. The country did this through innovative, low-cost public health programs: vast networks of NGO and government community health workers have driven down infant, child, and maternal mortality. For example, mass immunizations, oral rehydration therapy for diarrhea, family planning, and female education initiatives all improved survival. Researchers note Bangladesh ‚Äúoutperformed its Asian neighbors‚Ä¶defying the view that high spending is needed for better health‚Äù. In short, an emphasis on primary care and partnerships (public, private, NGO) allowed Bangladesh to convert each health dollar into large gains in life expectancy. </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>üî¥ Least Efficient Countries</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Swaziland (Eswatini):</strong> (Life Exp ~53.5 years; ~ 587 Dollars PPP per capita): In 2014, Eswatini was still grappling with the legacy of AIDS. Thanks to international funding, they achieved a high spending (580 PPP), much of it devoted to HIV treatment programs. et life expectancy was only ~53 years, placing Eswatini far below the trend line. The cause remained its extraordinary HIV prevalence (around 26% of adults). Although by 2014 antiretroviral therapy had become more available (Swaziland achieved >60% ART coverage by then), decades of AIDS devastation meant persistently elevated mortality. In the 2000s, life expectancy had literally been cut in half (to the 30s) before rebounding to the 50s with treatment scale-up. Even so, widespread co-infections like TB and the strain on the health system kept life expectancy low relative to spending. Essentially, no amount of money in the short run could fully offset the impact of HIV/AIDS on Swaziland‚Äôs demographics, making it appear very inefficient in 2014.  </li>
        <li><strong>Equatorial Guinea:</strong> (Life Exp ~60.2 years; ~ 1163 Dollars PPP per capita): Equatorial Guinea is a notorious example of a ‚Äúresource-curse‚Äù state with poor social outcomes. Flush with oil money, it spent a staggering ~$1.16k (PPP) per person on health in 2014 ‚Äì on paper one of the highest in Africa ‚Äì yet life expectancy was only ~60, below the African average. The core issue is governance and inequitable investment. Under a corrupt authoritarian regime, vast oil revenues have been siphoned into elites‚Äô pockets or prestige projects, with very little allocated to basic health services. In 2011, the government spent only $92 million on health (out of billions in oil income), focusing instead on infrastructure contracts that often benefited officials. By 2015, immunization rates for infants were shockingly low ‚Äì only ~25% coverage for polio/measles, among the worst in the world. Unsurprisingly, life expectancy and child mortality in Equatorial Guinea lag behind even poorer neighbors. The high spending figure likely reflects some specialized or private healthcare that serves the elite (and high costs in the capital), rather than effective public health for the population. Thus, Equatorial Guinea‚Äôs vast expenditures have yielded only 60 years life expectancy, due to mismanagement, corruption, and failure to invest in broad-based health systems.   </li>
        <li><strong>Namibia:</strong> (Life Exp ~59.3 years; ~$869 PPP per capita): Namibia in 2014 spent a hefty ~$869 PPP per person (thanks to diamond mining wealth and considerable health investment), yet life expectancy was about 59 ‚Äì very low for that spending level. The primary reason was the long-tail impact of HIV/AIDS. In the 1990s, Namibia‚Äôs life expectancy fell from ~61 years in 1993 to ~50 years in 2003 as AIDS became the leading cause of death. By 2014, with improved treatment, life expectancy had rebounded close to 60, but it was still nowhere near what an upper-middle-income country might achieve absent AIDS. Namibia‚Äôs epidemic, while slowly receding (adult prevalence ~13% in 2014), left a legacy of many middle-aged adults lost to disease, which skews life expectancy downward. Additionally, inequities between the relatively well-off urban population and the poorer, rural communities affected by apartheid-era disparities meant that not all segments benefited equally from health spending. For example, Namibia has world-class private hospitals used by the affluent, but many rural poor still lack access to quality care. These internal disparities and the HIV burden made Namibia‚Äôs overall outcomes lag. Consequently, in 2014 it appears ‚Äúinefficient,‚Äù with funding levels similar to some Eastern European countries but life expectancy ~20 years shorter. The country has since improved (life expectancy mid-60s by late 2010s), but in 2014 the resource allocation and epidemic aftermath kept it below the efficiency frontier. </li>
        <li><strong>South Sudan: </strong>Life Exp ~45.6 years; ~$73 PPP per capita): The world‚Äôs newest country in 2014, South Sudan, had one of the lowest life expectancies (mid-40s) despite moderate health spending for its income. After decades of civil war, South Sudan‚Äôs independence in 2011 was followed almost immediately by a new internal conflict (December 2013) ‚Äì a humanitarian catastrophe that decimated health services. By 2014, South Sudan had catastrophic health indicators: life expectancy in the mid-50s or below, under-5 mortality of 135 per 1,000 live births, and the world‚Äôs worst maternal mortality rate. Health expenditure included substantial international aid, but ongoing fighting made it nearly impossible to deliver care outside of UN protected camps. Hospitals and clinics were destroyed or abandoned in large parts of the country. As a result, money could not translate into effective healthcare ‚Äì South Sudan was essentially off the efficiency curve due to war and state failure. Every health outcome (vaccination, skilled birth attendance, clean water access) was among the world‚Äôs worst, so life expectancy remained around only 45‚Äì50 years. Until peace and governance improve, high spending will sadly yield little improvement, as seen in 2014.</li>
        <li><strong>Lesotho: </strong>(Life Exp ~50.8 years; ~$276 PPP per capita): Lesotho, a mountainous kingdom enveloped by South Africa, showed a similar pattern of high disease burden undermining health returns. With about $276 PPP per capita spending, Lesotho‚Äôs life expectancy (~51 years) was the second-lowest in the world in the mid-2010s. The driver was, again, HIV/AIDS, which infected ~25% of adults by 2014. Lesotho also suffers from one of the world‚Äôs highest TB infection rates (often HIV co-infection) and has difficult geography that hinders healthcare delivery to remote villages. Even though significant donor and government funds went into healthcare (including HIV programs), the country‚Äôs human resources for health were limited, and many HIV-positive individuals were not yet reached with therapy by 2014. The result was an extremely high adult mortality rate and life expectancy far below what its spending might predict. In short, Lesotho‚Äôs generalized AIDS epidemic and health system challenges meant money was not translating efficiently into years of life.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Conclusion: Efficiency Frontier Insights</h3>
      <p>
        Between 2000 and 2014 the global health efficiency frontier shifted upward (as many countries increased spending and achieved higher life expectancy), but the relative positions of countries were largely explained by the above factors. Nations that controlled communicable diseases, maintained peace/stability, and built inclusive primary health systems consistently punched above their weight in life expectancy. In contrast, those beset by pandemics (HIV), poor governance, or conflict showed the biggest shortfalls, often ‚Äúmissing‚Äù 10‚Äì20 years of life expectancy relative to their spending. Importantly, prioritizing PPP-adjusted per capita spending helps account for cost-of-living differences ‚Äì many of the efficient countries benefited from lower costs (e.g. hiring community nurses cheaply), further stretching each PPP-adjusted dollar. But as seen, it‚Äôs not just the amount of money (PPP or otherwise) ‚Äì it‚Äôs how it‚Äôs utilized. The efficiency frontier analysis thus highlights both success stories (e.g. Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Vietnam) and cautionary tales (e.g. Equatorial Guinea, conflict-torn states) to inform health policy. Investing in primary health care, addressing key diseases, and ensuring good governance emerge as decisive factors for converting health expenditure into the ultimate outcome: a longer, healthier life for the population.
